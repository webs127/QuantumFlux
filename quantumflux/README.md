## 🔐 QuantumFlux — Quantum-Secure Passwords & Future-Proof Encryption

QuantumFlux is a cutting-edge mobile security application that merges quantum computing concepts, advanced cybersecurity, and modern mobile development to deliver a new class of digital protection. Designed for individuals and professionals who demand stronger security than traditional systems can provide, QuantumFlux brings quantum-grade randomness and post-quantum encryption directly to your pocket.

At its core, QuantumFlux features a Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG) simulation engine inspired by principles of quantum entropy. Instead of relying on classical pseudo-random algorithms, QuantumFlux generates true, high-entropy randomness—the foundation of unbreakable passwords and cryptographically secure keys. Users receive real-time entropy analysis, allowing them to visually understand how strong and unpredictable each generated password truly is.

QuantumFlux goes a step further by integrating Kyber, a NIST-standardized post-quantum cryptographic algorithm engineered to remain secure even against the immense power of future quantum computers. The app uses Kyber’s Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) to establish a quantum-safe shared secret, which is then combined with AES-256-GCM to encrypt sensitive messages with exceptional speed, strength, and reliability.

Passwords and encrypted data are stored locally using Flutter Secure Storage, ensuring that all sensitive information stays encrypted and protected within the device's secure enclave. No cloud, no tracking, no exposure—your data remains yours.

With a sleek interface, smooth visual animations, and deep quantum security principles embedded within its architecture, QuantumFlux is more than just an app—it’s a glimpse into the future of personal cybersecurity.
QuantumFlux empowers you to secure your digital world with technology built for the next era.
